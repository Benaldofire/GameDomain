# GameDomain: Developed version of the initial-Game Domain program.
Website where people can find new upcoming games and discover games from different platforms. Full-Stack website, using MVC.

Status: Work in Progress

Note: I am currently Still working on the website, and I am learning a lot throughout the process. 
My plan is to expand on my idea as I continue to learn new techniques and technologies.

General outline - currently in progress.

- display a list of video games for different platforms.
- Give users the ability to sort and select the category of games they wish to view.
- Users will be able to view samples of the video game they want to know about.

In detail
- design a responsive website and optimize it for both mobile and desktop
- use an API that will return a list of video games
