  use that variable to retrieve the data needed, then render just one games page and pass the necessary data to it.

  also try '/:platform/:page' to get the page number to go to.

  maybe retrieve everything and store it in an array on the front end and then loop through it if the user goes to the next page. without refreshing the page, just use JS.
